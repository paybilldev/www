- Answering general how-to questions and providing pointers to documentation
- Troubleshooting supported software packages (Edge Functions, Webhooks, Auth) exhibiting erratic or faulty behavior on Paybill, independent of the user's application code

**Not Covered**

- General debugging of user applications

## Community Support

Paybill support staff will only address support requests received through the official channels mentioned earlier. However, community channels may exist for peer-to-peer support and discussions. This is support provided by volunteers that contribute to the Paybill community.

For questions related to debugging code, we recommend reaching out on **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/paybilldev/paybill/discussions)** or on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/v9rYchap)**. The community is made up of experienced developers who may be able to provide guidance and support with code-related issues.

To get the most helpful response from the community, providing precise and detailed information about your problem and any error messages you may be encountering is important. Be sure to **include any relevant code snippets explaining how to reproduce** the issue in your message.

Please note that Paybill team members may participate in community channels at their discretion, but there is no guarantee of response for support issues unless they are
submitted through one of the official channels above.

## Service Level Agreement

Service Level Agreements are only available to Enterprise customers. You can details of our SLA including support response times on the dedicated page for this topic -

## Proactive Monitoring

In the event of a platform issue, a notice will be posted on our platform status site at [paybill.statuspage.io](https://paybill.statuspage.io/) to promptly communicate the impact and status of any such issue. You do not need to submit a support ticket if there's an ongoing platform issue. Instead, monitor the status page which will always be kept up-to-date with the latest progress and information.
