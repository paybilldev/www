Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users, and any act or omission by an Authorized User that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by Customer will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Customer. Customer shall use reasonable efforts to make all Authorized Users aware of this Agreement's provisions as applicable to such Authorized User's use of the Services and shall cause Authorized Users to comply with such provisions.

### b. Third-Party Products

Paybill may from time to time make Third-Party Products available to Customer or Paybill may allow for certain Third-Party Products to be integrated with the Services to allow for the transmission of Customer Data from such Third-Party Products into the Services. For purposes of this Agreement, such Third-Party Products are subject to their own terms and conditions. If Customer does not agree to abide by the applicable terms for any such Third-Party Products, then Customer should not install or use such Third-Party Products. By authorizing Paybill to transmit Customer Data from Third-Party Products into the Services, Customer represents and warrants to Paybill that it has all right, power, and authority to provide such authorization.

### c. Customer Control and Responsibility

Customer has and will retain sole responsibility for:

Where paid-for services are agreed between Paybill and Customer per the Order, Customer shall pay Paybill the fees (“Fees”) identified in the Order without offset or deduction at the cadence identified in the Order (e.g., monthly or annually). Fees paid by Customer are non-refundable.  

If Customer fails to make any payment when due, and Customer has not notified Paybill in writing within ten (10) days of the payment becoming due and payable that the payment is subject to a good faith dispute, then, without limiting Paybill’s other rights and remedies:  

i. Paybill may charge interest on the undisputed past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month, calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law;  
ii. Customer shall reimburse Paybill for all reasonable costs incurred by Paybill in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys’ fees, court costs, and collection agency fees; and  
iii. if such failure continues for ten (10) days or more, Paybill may suspend Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ access to any portion or all of the Services until such amounts are paid in full.

#### i. Waiver of Withdrawal Right for EU and UK Consumers

If you are a resident of the European Union or the United Kingdom and subject to applicable consumer protection laws, you acknowledge that by creating a project or initiating use of the Paybill services during the 14-day statutory withdrawal period, the services will begin immediately at your request. Accordingly, you expressly consent to the immediate provision of the services and acknowledge that you waive your right to cancel the service and receive a refund under applicable consumer protection laws.

### b. Taxes

All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Customer is responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on Paybill's income. To the extent that Paybill is required by law to pay any such taxes, duties, or other charges to any governmental or regulatory authority, Paybill may invoice Customer for such taxes, duties, or other charges and Customer will pay such invoiced amounts in accordance with this Agreement.

### c. Credit Authorization and Fraud Prevention

To mitigate billing fraud and unauthorized usage, Paybill reserves the right to implement reasonable credit authorization, payment validation, and usage control measures, including but not limited to:  

i. preauthorization or validation of Customer’s payment method upon account creation or prior to provisioning Services;  
ii. applying initial or ongoing spend limits, usage caps, or throttling mechanisms to accounts with insufficient billing history or elevated risk profiles;  
iii. suspending or restricting access to Services where Paybill reasonably suspects fraudulent activity, failed payment authorization, or violation of usage terms;  
iv. delaying the provisioning of high-cost Services or infrastructure pending verification or authorization; and  
v. employing fraud-detection tools and analytics, including third-party services, to assess and manage risk.  

Paybill will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer prior to suspending or restricting Service access under this Section, except in cases of suspected fraud, payment failure, or material risk to Paybill’s infrastructure or systems. Customer agrees to cooperate with any reasonable verification or remediation steps required by Paybill to restore access.

## 6. Confidential Information.

### a. Definition

From time to time during the Subscription Period, either Party may disclose or make available to the other Party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media that:  

i. is marked, designated, or otherwise identified as “confidential” or something similar at the time of disclosure or within a reasonable period of time thereafter; or  
ii. would be considered confidential by a reasonable person given the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure

a. in the public domain;  
b. known to the receiving Party at the time of disclosure;  
c. rightfully obtained by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party; or  
d. independently developed by the receiving Party without use of, reference to, or reliance upon the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

### b. Duty

The receiving Party will be responsible for all the acts and omissions of its Representatives as they relate to Confidential Information hereunder.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required:

## 9. Warranties; Disclaimer

### a. Customer

Customer represents, warrants, and covenants to Paybill that Customer owns or otherwise has and will have the necessary rights and consents in and relating to the Customer Data so that, as received by Paybill and processed in accordance with this Agreement, they do not and will not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property, privacy or other rights of any third party or violate any applicable laws or regulations.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  

Customer agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the **High Court of Kenya** and any other competent courts within Kenya for any actions for which Paybill retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, including to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of data security, Confidential Information, or intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.

Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.

#### iii. Dispute-Resolution Process

For any Claim, the Customer will first contact Paybill at **[legal@paybill.dev](mailto:legal@paybill.dev)** and attempt to resolve the Claim with Paybill informally.

If the Parties are unable to resolve the Claim after sixty (60) days, the Claim shall be finally settled under the **Rules of Arbitration** ("**Rules**") of the **International Chamber of Commerce** ("**ICC**") by one or more arbitrators (each, an "**Arbitrator**") appointed in accordance with such Rules.

##### **Arbitration Location**

The place of arbitration shall be:

* **Kenya** – if the Customer is located in Africa;
* **Singapore** – if the Customer is located in Asia;
* **London, United Kingdom** – if the Customer is located in Europe;
* **San Francisco County, California** – if the Customer is located in the United States or any other jurisdiction.

(Unless the Parties agree otherwise.)

##### **Fees and Costs**

* If the Customer is using the Service for **commercial purposes**:

  * Each party will be responsible for paying any ICC filing and administrative fees, as well as Arbitrator fees, in accordance with the Rules.
  * The award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.

* If the Customer is an **individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes**:

  1. ICC may require the Customer to pay a fee for the initiation of a case.
  2. The award rendered by the Arbitrators may include the Customer’s costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
  3. The Customer may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve the Customer of the obligation to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.

##### **Authority of the Arbitrator**

* Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
* The Parties agree that the Arbitrators, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have **exclusive authority** to resolve any disputes relating to:

  * The scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement.
  * Any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
* The Arbitrator will also determine all **threshold arbitrability issues**, including whether this Agreement or any provision is unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration (e.g., waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel).


#### iv. Equitable Relief

Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed as: preventing Paybill from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of Paybill's data security, confidential information, or intellectual property rights; or preventing Customer from asserting claims in a small claims court, provided that Customer's claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-collective, and non-representative) basis.

#### v. Severability

If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the Parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent Customer from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the Parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

### c. Representative Proceedings and Arbitration Limitations

By entering into this Agreement, each Party agrees that disputes shall be resolved on an individual basis and not through any representative or collective proceedings, except as may be expressly permitted under Kenyan law. To the fullest extent permissible, the Parties waive the right to bring, join, or participate in any purported representative suit, including but not limited to proceedings under Order 1 Rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules, unless such participation is required by statute or ordered by a competent court.

The foregoing applies to all users (both natural persons and entities), regardless of whether the Customer has obtained or used the service for personal, commercial, or other purposes. Unless the Parties expressly agree otherwise, any arbitration conducted under this Agreement shall be limited to the claims of the individual claimant, and the arbitrator shall not have authority to consolidate multiple claims or to award relief on a representative basis. The arbitrator may award relief only to the extent necessary to resolve the individual dispute, and any relief granted shall not affect other users.

## 14. Miscellaneous.

### a. Entire Agreement  

This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter.  

In the event of any inconsistency between the statements made in the body of this Agreement, the related Exhibits, and any other documents incorporated herein by reference, the following order of precedence governs:  
1. **First**, this Agreement; and  
2. **Second**, any other documents incorporated herein by reference.  

### b. Notices  

All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a "**Notice**") must be:  

- **In writing** and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or as identified on the Order Form (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section).  
- **Delivered by**:
  - personal delivery,  
  - nationally recognized signed-for-on-delivery courier (with all fees pre-paid), or  
  - email (with confirmation of transmission).  

All email Notices to **Paybill** must be sent to:  
`legal@paybill.dev`  

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only:  
1. **Upon receipt** by the receiving Party; and  
2. If the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section 14(b).  

**Electronic Communications Consent**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer hereby consents to receiving electronic communications from Paybill, which may include notices about applicable fees and charges, transactional information, and other information concerning or related to the Services.  

Customer agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that Paybill sends to Customer electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.

### c. Force Majeure

In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments), if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such Party's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.

### d. Amendment and Modification

Paybill may change this Agreement (except for any Orders) from time to time at its discretion. The date on which the Agreement was last modified will be updated at the top of this Agreement. Paybill will provide Customer with reasonable notice prior to any amendments or modifications taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with Customer's account on the Services or by another method reasonably designed to provide notice to Customer. If Customer accesses or uses the Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement, such access and use will constitute Customer's acceptance of the revised Agreement beginning at the next Renewal Subscription Period or, if Customer enters into a new Order with Paybill, as of the date of execution of such Order.

### e. Waiver

No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy available to it in connection with this Agreement will constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. No waiver under this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party granting the waiver.

### f. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their original intent as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

### g. Assignment

Customer may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Paybill. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section will be null and void. No assignment or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

### h. Equitable Relief

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 6 or, in the case of Customer, Section 2(c), would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.

### i. Publicity

Paybill may identify Customer as a user of the Services and may use Customer's name, logo, and other trademarks in Paybill's customer list, press releases, blog posts, advertisements, and website (and all use thereof and goodwill arising therefrom shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of Customer). Otherwise, neither Party may use the name, logo, or other trademarks of the other Party for any purpose without the other Party's prior written approval.
